That small waterwheel and the lake's water circulation can maintain a stable water supply for the planting area.

It's a truly automatic ecological cycle, self-sufficient.

He strolled over to the livestock area, which was enclosed by a fence.

Ten little lambs were timidly huddled together, heads down, nibbling at the rapidly growing tender grass beneath their hooves;

Ten calves curiously sniffed the ground with their noses, occasionally letting out a tender 'moo';

The chicks, ducklings, and goslings were even more joyful, pecking around in the grass and chasing each other, full of vitality.

They also seemed to have fully adapted to the environment, and even appeared more energetic than when they were first bought, thanks to the abundant and energy-rich food of grass and insects.

"Alright, none of them died, and they can find their own food," Wu Changsheng nodded again.

The free-range chickens, free-range ducks, and grass-fed geese raised from these would definitely taste amazing in the future.

After a round of inspection, Wu Changsheng expressed satisfaction with the initial operational status of this Giant Island Turtle Manor.

Everything was developing in the ideal direction of no management needed, automatic operation, and self-sufficiency.

He yawned, feeling a bit bored.

Inspection complete, it was time to get down to business.

He walked into the brand new three-story villa. The interior furniture was complete, and there was even a faint scent of wood.
